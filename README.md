# Power BI - Global Superstore Sales Project
### **I. Project Assumption**
Global Superstore is a retail company in diverse fields such as Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies,... . Senior Manager needs more information of business performance to build and develop market expanding strategy and strategic products. As a data analyst, I need to explore, visualize data and based on it to find out insight and give recommendation for my Senior Manager by using:
- Data set: The dataset used in this project is the Global Superstore dataset, containing sales data from a fictional retail store
- Data table: Including 3 data tables:
  + Orders (Fact table): Recording information related to Sales order
  + People (Dim table): Saving Salesperson and region information respectively
  + Returns (Dim table): Recording information related to Return sales order
- Tool: Power BI
### **II. Project Objectives**
Finding out insight of data set and give answers for 3 key questions:
1. How is the business performance of company?
2. Where are the potential markets?
3. Which products can be strategic?
### **III. Data Modeling and Visualization**
To standardize data, I create an additional table called "Dim_date" and based on data of each table, I used Star Schema to execute data modeling

Then, I visualize data via 3 dashboards which will solve 3 question as mentioned above respectively:
